# ActivationDelayInClinicalTrials

This repo contains scripts utilized for the numerical study in the paper "Impacts of site activation time to clinical trial costs," in construction, by Michael LeFew, Javier Rubio, and Anh Ninh.

### Distribution of cohort recruitment

This script undertakes simulations analysed in the secion Modeling and assumptions

### Activation and delay costs

This script undertakes simulations analysed in the following sections:
1. Analysis of clinical trial costs
2. Value of considering activation delay
3. Multi-stage opening scheme

### Effect of lowering activation time

This script undertakes simultations analysed in the section Effect of reducing activation time
